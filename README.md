# [Kata Seeds](http://kata-seeds.github.io): [Erlang](http://www.erlang-lang.org)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kata-seeds/erlang-seed.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kata-seeds/erlang-seed)

## Getting Started

Clone this repo with `git`:

    git clone https://github.com/kata-seeds/erlang-seed.git
    cd erlang-seed

Install dependencies and run your tests with `make`:

    make

You should eventually see 1 test ran and 0 failures. If `make` doesn't work for you, please open an issue.

Now you can start your kata! May we suggest the [Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)?
